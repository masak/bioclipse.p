============================
=== Plan for Bioclipse-P ===
============================

=====
Tasks
=====

* Create SVN or git repo for Bioclipse-P so everyone can test the program
* Get EMF-GMF to work, i.e. follow some tutorial
	- We want a canvas where we can drag-and-drop boxes and other symbols, which represent different operators
	- Look at and perhaps borrow code from Knime and RapidMiner
	- How give input (i.e. set parameters) to operators? Wizard? Multipage editor? Something else?
	- How save the current state of a session? Let operators wrap around XML-files or something similar?
* Couple R functionality to the boxes
	- rJava
	- Look at and perhaps borrow code from JGR
* iPred handles cross-validation etc.
	- Computing on the language to handle stacking of operators which are executed inside a cross-validation loop
	- Write predict methods for preprocessing operators (R does not provide this in general)
* Enable spreadsheet functionality via *** (same library that Arvid is using). It must be able to deal with strings (i.e. not only numbers) and grouping of columns and rows.
* Enable interactive plotting via the iPlots R-package, which is written in Java. It will have to be extended.

=============
Distant tasks
=============

* Make HPC resources available via the graphical user interface
	- Parallelize (R/parallel, snow, RHIPE packages)
* Enable other computational backends, e.g. BUGS/JAGS, Weka etc.
	
====================
Graphical components
====================

* Tree view with operators logically grouped into packages. The operators are drag-and-dropable into the canvas area.
* Model view with logical grouping of models (peak at JGR)
* Spreadsheet functionality
* Data view..? (Which datasets are loaded?)
* Plotting view or editor (with backtracking to original data)
* Chemical view (JChemPaint and Jmol)
* Biological view (alignment editor and Jmol, connection to Bioconductor)

=======
Writing
=======

* Tutorial about how to enable more R-functionality in Bioclipse-P
* Article in Journal of Statistical Software or application note in Bioinformatics or BMC Bioinformatics
* Article in Rnews
* Article in Journal of Chemometrics or Journal of Cheminformatics

==========
Time frame
==========

* When can we have a working prototype?
* How much time do the different tasks outlined above take?

===================
The first use cases
===================

* Cross-validated lm.ridge operation from start to end (lm.ridge instead of lm because lm.ridge involves setting a parameter)
	- Centering and scaling of data
	- Cross-validation of the whole procedure
* Random forest
